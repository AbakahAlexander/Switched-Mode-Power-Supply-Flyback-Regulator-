# Switched-Mode-Power-Supply-Flyback-Regulator-
The purpose of the simulation was to see how the flyback converter operates in various modes and to have a look at typical operating waveforms. Some calculations were also performed to compare measurements with the idealised theory. 
Measurements are taken to confirm the high efficiency of the circuit. 
The simulation was done in Matlab and simulink.
